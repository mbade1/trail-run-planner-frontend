How to solve npm error “npm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE”
    1: npm cache clean --force
    2: rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
    3: npm install
    4: npm start


Added: loginContainer, journalContainer, imported trail image, and changed App.js to only render loginContainer


MAKE FETCH CALL TO GET WEATHER FOR COORDINATES AS WELL?????????
    - Have a Weather container at the top of the search page that gets the coordinates. 3 Asynch fetch calls made (geolocation, trails, and weather)
    - Display temperature, %rain, etc...


Saving trails into db - need to have a fetch call to search trails by ID when User pulls up individual trails.
